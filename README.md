# Clarity

Clarity is an example library that frames and provides easily-maintained systems.  The goal is to provide instant ramp-up on the given code base to greatly reduce the cost of developer transition.

Clarity is written in c# and .NET 4.7.1

The Clarity Solution (sln) file contains the following projects:
* Clarity - the core library
* Clarity.Examples - a simple library showing a potential use case for the clarity framework
* Clarity.Examples.Tests - a set of unit tests to make sure it all glues together properly
